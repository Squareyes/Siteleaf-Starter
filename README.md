# Siteleaf Starter

### Starter template for Siteleaf builds, powered by Jekyll.

## Getting up and Running
- Clone down and enter directory
- Install bundle via Ruby gems
- Run `bundle install`
- Run `npm install`
- Then for development you'll need to run `gulp` and `bundle exec jekyll serve` at the same time. This is a WIP and will be streamlined into a single process with hot reloading soon.
